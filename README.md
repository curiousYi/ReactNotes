# React Notes

A Simple CRUD App written in that contains a front-end and back-end powered by
React and Express.

## Major To-Dos
* Set-up Redux
* Set-up CSS plugins for webpack + other features like code-splitting
* Hook up a database using Sequelize+Postgres
* Add authentication
* Use https
* Use sockets to make it more real-time?

### Minor To-Dos
*Correct the references in the index html file to refer to server
*Modify Routes to hook up with our "fake session storage "
*Add validation to the server
*Add error handling to the server
*Modify the server posting of resources so that things like Mary === mary and aren't unique
*Use proptypes to do basic validation on the front end
